# UDP protocols

A program to simulate client server communications via UDP. The protocols demonstrated are the Stop and Wait protocol and the Go-Back-N protocol

# Usage

1. After cloning the repository go to your terminal to run the program.
2. Navigate to the respective directory based on which protocol you want to try e.g. `cd go-back-n` for the Go-Back-N protocol
3. Compile the java files e.g. `javac Client.java`
4. Run the both the client and server files to see the program run e.g. `java Server.kava`. The order in which the files are run is not important

There are examples of what your output should look like in each directory.
